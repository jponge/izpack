 Caution for configuration manager!
 
 This text file contains Japanese, many of which characters' value
 could be in 8 bits. So if you are not using 8-bit through environment,
 please handle this file as a binary file, otherwise, this file will
 be broken.

 - some e-mail transfer drops 8th bit
 - standard CVS may not handle 8th bit (treat as binary file)

<!--

 The reason to choose Shift_JIS for this resource file

 Ideally, Unicode encoding (like UTF-8) should be used.

 As each platform uses different encodings,
  Windows   : Shift_JIS (strictly speaking, may be Windows-31J)
  most Unix : EUC_JIS
  Macintosh : (I do not know)

 However, some strings are given to native library and used for Windows
 shortcut, so this should be in Windows encoding.
